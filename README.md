<h2>User Story</H2>

<p>AS AN employer</p>
<p>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples</p>
<p>SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:</p>
<p>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work</p>
<p>WHEN I load their portfolio</p>
<p>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</p>
<p>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation</p>
<p>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</p>
<p>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work</p>
<p>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</p>
<p>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application</p>
<p>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</p>
<p>WHEN I click on the images of the applications</p>
<p>THEN I am taken to that deployed application</p>
<p>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices</p>
<p>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</p>
